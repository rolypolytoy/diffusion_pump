# Compact Diffusion Pump
A compact diffusion pump design- a modification of https://grabcad.com/library/diffusion-pump-1 for accessibility, gasket flexibility, size, and functionality 

## What is a Diffusion Pump?
A diffusion pump is a kind of vacuum pump specifically geared for HV (high vacuum) systems- in conjunction with a roughing pump, usually a rotary vane, it can produce pressures of 1e-4 to 1e-6 torr or lower, in correctly designed vacuum systems. It's notable for requiring no moving parts- merely a nozzle assembly, silicone oil, a heater, and a water cooling system. This sounds like a lot of requirements, but the requirements for an alternate kind of vacuum pump used for HV systems- turbomolecular pumps- are far greater, and these are more difficult to manufacture, balance, and operate.

## What does this design do?
This design fits in a 250 mm height, 200 mm diameter cylinder, which is remarkably small for a vacuum pump, and can pump several dozen L/s if correctly manufactured. The jet assembly's design is taken from a cross-section of a diffusion model in https://grabcad.com/library/diffusion-pump-1. One of the .catpart files had a splice of it. A duplication of the splice, rotation, merging and rescaling was necessary, as well as the conversion of the file to a more accessible format in the form of .step. In addition- the Diffusion_Pump.step file is made entirely by me- the exterior of the diffusion pump provided is subpar for several reasons. A corrugated design is harder to manufacture, it didn't have standardized inlets and outlets. The flange is custom-designed by me, with the holes in the gasket being exactly 8 mm long to allow for the utilization of 9 mm ID Viton O-rings, instead of a gasket. 

## What can it do?
After CNC manufacturing and assembly with the right components, this may be able to produce HV vacuum pressures in a vacuum chamber. There's only one way to find out.

## What license is this with?
None. Use this as you will, modify it, share it, there are no limitations.
